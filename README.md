One year ago, I had just finished university and I realised that working in tech was where I needed to be. So, I joined the Makers Academy Bootcamp to make the switch and am now pursuing my first job as a junior software developer. I'm currently working hard to develop my technical skills, coding process, and application process to make the life I want a reality.
