One year ago, I had just finished university and I realised that working in tech was where I needed to be. So, I joined the Makers Academy Bootcamp to make the switch and am now pursuing my first job as a junior software developer. I'm currently working hard to develop my technical skills, coding process, and application process to make the life I want a reality.

<h3>Positive communication</h3>
<p>During our second project at makers teammates were tired and getting overwhelmed by the work. I immediately calmed people down, noting we were low on energy but had made progress. When leading that day’s retro, I emphasised what we had achieved in spite of a difficult project and managed to reframe that day. This helped manage stress and meant we were able to work much more effectively the following morning.
</p>

 <h3>Problem understanding and solving</h3>
 <p>During projects, when teammates experienced a logic based blocker, I was the person who was called to go into a deep think and understand how the system needed to work. This combined with an insistence on gaining visibility step by step on bugs meant I was able to methodically free myself and others from technical blockers.</p>
* Eager to work in a team, accept feedback, and learn from others
* Calm communication and conflict resolution
