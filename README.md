## Kenny Sweeney-Baird

After finishing a degree in ancient Roman and Greek history, I realised that despite being interested in many subjects, working in tech was closest to who I was. Learning how to learn was a crucial takeaway from university, and I wanted to apply this to programming which gives the creative freedom to explore my interests. Technical expertise is the most enabling skill of the 21st century and I knew I had to be part of it.

## Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Final project**            | A webapp to do x. | React, Jest, etc. |
| **Something else worked on** | A webapp to do y. | Ruby              |

## Work Experience

**Company Name** (start-date to end-date)  
_Your job title_

- Any experience, including roles and responsibilities and results achived in bullet point format.

**Company Name** (start-date to end-date)  
_Your job title_

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### Efficient learning

When faced with a new topic I am unfamilliar with, I can research what the most effective way to learn it is, identify subgoals and consistently work to improve it.
For example, when learning OOP and design patterns for the first time I asked more experienced people what was the best way to learn it. After receiving book recommendations, I read, noted, and practiced implementing them, aiming to understand the topic to commit it to memory.


- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### King's College London 2019-2021

- Classical Studies 
- 1st

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
